# Introduction 
This project is a web application where users can create notes in a hierarchical way(tree). It is a little project I have done some years ago to learn and teach Clean Architecture and correlating technologies as a practical project. It is not a finish project. I am mainly a backend developr so the UI is far from good. It was done using one of the first versions of blazor as it is a little buggy and the intend is to rewrite-it using better UI technologies such as ReactJS or something else. 
This project is good to learn the folowing technologies:

- Clean Architecture
- Domain Driven Design (DDD)
- JWT Authentication tokens
- MediaTR/CQRS
- Basics of Mongo DB
- Basics of Redis
- Blazor-Client(Old version)
